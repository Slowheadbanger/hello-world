learning


I have been tryng to learn to build my own programs for years but I'm missing some key fundementals that I just don't understand or can't seem to find. Somehow I have started over many many times at the basics. The actual taking the code and building it for something usealbe and away from the basic variable declarations and iterations is where I think I need to be...I just don't know how to apply them to average programs.
